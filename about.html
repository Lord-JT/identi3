I am a Senior at the University of Michigan and have experience running a small business. My goal is to be able to do this full time after school and to provide a long lasting, solid project on the solana blockchain. Our team does not have a lot of experience working with other projects but I can promise you that our standards are set high for ourselves and that we are learning and growing in the space everyday, just as we hope we can help you do.<br><br>-Shmeaty</p></div><div class="about-someone single-box"><img src="./Final Images/Logo Zoomed Out.png" alt="Image of JT Thompson" class="profile-pic"><h2 class="name">JT Thompson</h2><h4 class="role">Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</h4><p class="about-them">My name is JT, and like Ethan I am a student at the University of Michigan. I am studying Computer Science and Engineering which helped me gain the experience in coding and web development to help launch this project. I have been interested in the world of crypto for quite some time and have been a holder of multiple NFT projects, but this is my first project where I am the lead developer. When Ethan approached me with the idea to start this project, I was super excited to put my time and effort into trying to make this project one of the best on the blockchain. I've had a blast working on this project so far and I am so excited to build my reputation as a developer in this space. I am also looking forward getting to meet some of y'all and hope you give us your faith as we do our best to take this project to the moon!<br><br>-LordJT</p></div><div class="about-someone single-box"><img src="./Final Images/Logo Zoomed Out.png" alt="Image of Logo" class="profile-pic"><h2 class="name">Anonymous</h2><h4 class="role">Artist</h4><p class="about-them">Our artist preferred to stay anonymous, but they have extensive experience creating artwork and put in a lot of work generating the artwork for this project.</p></div></div><footer class="main-footer"><ul><li><h3><span><img src=".\Final Images\Footer Logo.png" height="25"></span></h3></li><li class="discord-button"><a href="https://discord.gg/88HP2d5MDt" target="_blank"><img src=".\Final Images\Discord White.png" height="25"></a></li><li class="instagram-button"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/identi3nft/" target="_blank"><img src=".\Final Images/Instagram Inverted.png" height="21"></a></li><li class="twitter-button"><a href="https://twitter.com/Identi3nft" target="_blank"><img src=".\Final Images/Twitter Bird White.png" height="18"></a></li></ul></footer></div></body></html>
