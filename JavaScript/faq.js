To do that, follow the below steps:<br><ol><li>Head to <a href="https://phantom.app/" target="_blank">https://phantom.app/</a>.</li><li>Click download and then download either the app for your mobile device or the extension for your browser. We reccomend pinning it as an extension.</li><li>Because you\'re looking at this tutorial, you likely don\'t have a recovery phrase. So, select "Create New Wallet". This will then give you a secret recovery phrase which is a series of words that will allow you to get back into your wallet if you log out or move to a different device or something. It is absolutely imperative that you write this down somewhere. Do not store this online. It is best to keep it written somewhere secure and have multiple copies in case of accidental loss. Do NOT give this phrase to anyone else. No one reputable will EVER ask you for this phrase. If someone gets this phrase, they will be able to drain your account.</li><li>Now that you have your recovery phrase, create your password (make it a good one!) and agree to the terms and services.</li><li>Finally, you should be able to just click finish. Congrats, you now have a cryptowallet!</li></ol>Of course, this is just a basic quick tutorial and there are much more in-depth guides on the internet. If you have any trouble or want to learn more about Phantom Wallet, we highly recommend checking those out.<br><br> Note: You can have as many wallets as you want! Phantom supports having multiple wallets on one account. Something you can do to increase safety is have a main wallet to store the majority of your funds and smaller, project specific wallets to purchase, invest, transact, etc. so that your main wallet is NEVER exposed. Just be aware that transferring funds between wallets does cost a very small fee, around $0.00025 (USD).'),"solana"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML="Solana, abbreviated SOL, is a cryptocurrency and a platform running on it's own blockchain (see blockchain explanation in another question). The idea or reason behind Solana was to increase transaction speed, reduce gas fees, and maintain a decentralized platform, and it does all of these successfully. One of the notable things that Solana did was use a consensus mechanism called proof-of-history combined with proof-of-stake. What this means is that Solana has complex algorithms in which timestamps are used to define the next block in the block chain and anyone with Solana to stake can be a block validator and help legitimize new transactions proposed to the chain. Why would one be interested in being a validator? Because successful validation rewards the validator with a bit of currency. Inccorect validation will void the validators stake. And, in order to achieve consensus, a majority of validators must agree on a transaction. This makes it difficult to push fraudulent transactions or take over the network. Now, this method of consensus is important because previous, or other, methods, namely proof-of-work, required people, called miners, to race to be the first to propose a new block using mathematical algorithms. This proposed block would then be validated. But, the race to propose a new block causes massive amounts of energy to be used which really reduces scalability and drives up transaction fees, called gas fees. This is why ethereum was known for high gas fees and is moving/moved to a proof of stake consensus system.Because of this system, as well as other algorithms, Solana is one of the fastest, scalable, and inexpensive blockchains around, currently running at over 4,000 transactions per second at an average cost of $0.00025 (USD) per transaction.Ethereum for reference operates at about 12-15 transactions per second at a cost of around $2.72 (USD) per transaction. Solana can theoretically achieve speeds up to 710,000 transactions per second, which is 400 times faster than Visa and 150 times faster than Mastercard. Thus, it is in our opinion that Solana provides the best platform for a world that is built on transactions and any project that shoots to have a high number of transactions per second should look to the Solana blockchain."),"blockchain"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML='A blockchain, simply put, is just the way that data is stored in the world of cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is really just a record of transactions, and these transactions are what "store" the state of any individual wallet, balance, NFT, etc. This record is publicly available and constantly maintained and validated by a decentralized network of volunteers around the world. For example, the balance of any given wallet is really just a sum of all the transactions associated with that wallet, and all of that information is stored on the blockchain.'),"security"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML="Generally speaking, yes, a blockchain is very secure. For one, nothing on a blockchain points back to you unless you share your public key or people know that it is yours. In other words, a blockchain provides anonymity. Additionally, a blockchain is very hard to hack or take over because they are decentralized. A blockchain is maintained across a network of computers and whichever blockchain is agreed upon by a majority of the computers IS the working blockchain. This means if you wanted to fraudulently edit the blockchain, you would need to either hack over 50% of the computers on the network or run enough computers to have a 50% say. Neither of these tasks are very feasible to do. Furthermore, the way a blockchain contains information is such that part of the information in each block is based on the information that came before it. This means if you wanted to edit the block or transaction that occured 10 blocks ago, you have to edit and recalculate the latest 10 blocks! This of course could take a large amount of time depending on how far back a hacker tries to go, so generally older transactions would be extremely difficult to change. This makes the blockchain very secure as it grows. Finally, blockchains employ various other security features such as crytography, public and private keys, access verification, privacy maintenance, etc. So, yes, the blockchain is inherently secure. 99 out of 100 times, when someone gets hacked or loses their crypto it is because they were scammed or tricked into giving up their private keys or secure phrase. Thus, always keep these private and never share them with anybody!"),"keys"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML="Keys are associated with your wallet.A private key should never be shared with someone you don't trust and no one ever needs your private key for a transaction. Essentially, the keys are used to encrypt information before sending. Only the owner of a specific private key can decrypt the information whereas anyone can use a persons public key to encrypt the information. In simple terms, a public key is something that can be used by anybody to send a transaction to the wallet or contract that is associated with that public key, but only the person with the private key can approve the transaction. Long story short, use your public keys for transactions but PROTECT your private keys."),"deposit"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML='To deposit some SOL, you are going to need an account on an exchange. A very common one is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>. Once you create an account, you can buy whatever crypto you want, send it to appropriate wallets, receive it from wallets, etc. So, to get some SOL, you would buy some from Coinbase (for example) and send it to your wallet using the public key of your wallet. You can also send crypto back from your wallet to your Coinbase account by using you Coinbase address as a transaction in your wallet. We highly recommend exercising extreme caution when doing transactions as they are irreversible. If a mistake is made, you will not be able to get your crypto back. Please find some additional tutorials online to show you exactly how to do this. The process isn\'t hard, but it can feel very new/different.'),"nft"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML="NFT stands for non-fungible token, which essentially means it is unique and has its own value. An NFT can be held in your wallet just like a coin, like ETH, SOL, or BitCoin. But, any given coin can be traded for another coin of the same type; they are indistinguishable. NFT's are distinguishable. You would not be able to trade the NFT for another one of the same or an equivalent. Your NFT is unique. Just about anything can be an NFT; an image, a video, audio, animation, etc, and exactly like artwork in real life a specific NFT has its own specific value. NFTs are also typically a part of a collection of similar NFTs, with each NFT having a specific rarity. There are a variety of reasons to hold an NFT, but there are two main ones. The first reason is that it is an investment and can be a way to store money. The other reason to hold it is that holding an NFT can sometimes put you in an exclusive group that gets something, like other coins or access to features, just because you hold the NFT. This is generally referred to as the utility of an NFT."),"music-nft"==document.getElementById("qs").value&&(document.getElementById("qs-answer").innerHTML="A Music NFT is basically music that is sold in the form of NFT’s.
